# **Gina-Windley | Portfolio site**

A simple portfolio site to display Gina Windleys architecture work.

The site uses [trianglify](http://qrohlf.com/trianglify/) to create different random abstract patterns as BG-images, and [vueperslides](https://antoniandre.github.io/vueper-slides/) to create a mobile friendly easy to use slider.

#

### **Project setup**
```
npm install
```

### **Compiles and hot-reloads for development**
```
npm run serve
```

### **Deploys to gh-pages**

This script runs the 'npm run build' command which builds the project using the vue-cli-service (webpack under the hood)

It has been configured to create a CNAME file to confirm to gh-pages the domain name that the site is set too

```
bash ./deploy.sh
```
