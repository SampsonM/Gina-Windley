The proposal restores the docks, which have since been filled in, preserving the site's history visually. Its industrial use is demonstrated by the presence of a manufacturing facility, a training college, and a 'model village' of prefabricated self-build timber kit homes manufactured on-site. The project aims to address homelessness at its source through the tourism and manufacturing economies, providing on-site housing, training, and employment of Manchester's homeless and disadvantaged population.</p><p>The buildings are linked by a public procession that creates a spectacle of the manufacture, taking visitors on a journey through the factory to the training college exhibition and ending in at the café, all set within the nature reserve. The factory uses Manchester's industrial artery, the shipping canal, for delivery and distribution of manufactured prefab homes across the country.</p>",

The elements - sky, earth, wind, water, fire and soil are tangible: Sk-Eye connects the visitor with the sky and rain, the charred timber cladding drapes around the structure. The form of the structure is influenced by the circular form of the Welsh roundhouse and is modernised into a timber hexagonal volume which tapers to create the oculus. Two doors welcome visitors off the trail and into the structure. Within an installation consists of the documentation of memories of people visiting and living at CAT. Cast in resin and wax, these are positioned as a chandelier capturing sunlight and rainwater, celebrating the infamous Welsh weather.<br><br>Sk-Eye is elegant and simple, the primary structure is constructed of larch, which was sourced within 2 miles of the site, and left untreated. The timber cladding was salvaged and reclaimed from the CAT site, to evoke memories of components which once had another life. The members are treated using the ancient Japanese method for charring timber, the Shou Sugi Ban. The warm larch structure contrasts with the black charred timber. <br><br>The structure was constructed in a week in Summer 2018 by a team of 5 MArch Sustainable Architecture students, forming a place for the exchange of knowledge, memory, people, place and architecture set within nature.<br><br>View this project in the AJ buildings library <a target=\"blank\" href=\"https://www.ajbuildingslibrary.co.uk/projects/display/id/8109\"> here</a>.</p>",

The new visitor centre and youth hostel facility at Steel Rigg celebrates the crags and the local landscape and raises awareness and respect for the outdoor activities in the area, particularly climbing. The centre will aim to educate people on climbing through both indoor and outdoor climbing walls. The Northumberland Outward Bounds Centre will become a place for the public to visit and learn about destinations and many activities within the National Park.<br><br> The visitor centre form and layout is influenced by the local agricultural architecture and the verticality of the crags. The buildings are split up into a collection of buildings which evoke a welcoming and secure atmosphere. The accommodation cabins scatter the landscape replicating the Milecastles along Hadrian’s Wall. The Climbing and Viewing tower will provide climbing educational opportunities to visitors and spectacular views of the surrounding landscape. With the potential to attract a significant number of visitors from the landscape the tower will become a beacon and connect the building to area, attracting visitors from all around.</p>",
